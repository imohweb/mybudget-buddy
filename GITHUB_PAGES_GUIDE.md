# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Budget Buddy app to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: Make sure you have a GitHub account
2. **Repository**: Create a new repository on GitHub named `budget-buddy-app`

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
3. Name it `budget-buddy-app`
4. Make it public (required for free GitHub Pages)
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/budget-buddy-app.git

# Rename main branch (GitHub uses 'main' by default)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
5. The deployment will start automatically

### 4. Configure Repository Settings (if needed)

If you encounter permission issues:

1. Go to repository "Settings" â†’ "Actions" â†’ "General"
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
4. Save changes

## Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer manual deployment using gh-pages:

```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run deploy
```

This will:
1. Build the app
2. Deploy to the `gh-pages` branch
3. GitHub Pages will serve from this branch

## Accessing Your Deployed App

Once deployed, your app will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/budget-buddy-app/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **404 Error**: Make sure the repository is public and Pages is enabled
2. **Build Fails**: Check the Actions tab for error details
3. **Wrong Base Path**: Ensure `vite.config.ts` has the correct base path

### Check Deployment Status

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. Check the latest workflow run

### Force Redeploy

If you need to redeploy:

```bash
# Make a small change and commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger redeploy"
git push
```
